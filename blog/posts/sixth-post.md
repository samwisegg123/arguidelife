Let's be honest: the biggest question on everyone's mind when it comes to life insurance is, "How much is this going to cost me?"

There's a persistent myth that life insurance is incredibly expensive. A recent study showed that most people overestimate the true cost by more than 3x! The reality is that for a healthy individual, securing hundreds of thousands of dollars in protection can often cost less than a daily coffee habit or a monthly streaming subscription.

My mission is to bring transparency to this process. Let's pull back the curtain and look at the four simple factors that *actually* determine your premium.

### An Illustrative Example (Not a Quote!)

To give you a real-world ballpark, let's look at a common scenario: a healthy 35-year-old non-smoker.

* **Goal:** Get $500,000 of coverage for 20 years to protect their family while their kids are young and their mortgage is high.
* **Policy Type:** A 20-Year Term policy.
* **Estimated Monthly Premium:** Often in the range of **$25 - $40 per month.**

Yes, you read that right. Half a million dollars of peace of mind for less than the cost of a weekly pizza night.

### How an Independent Agent Helps

The prices above are just illustrations. The real key to getting the best price is working with an independent agent. Every insurance carrier looks at your profile differently. One company might be more favorable to someone with high blood pressure, while another might offer better rates for a different condition.

My job is to know the market and submit your application to the carrier that will view your profile most favorably, ensuring you get the best possible price for the protection your family needs.
