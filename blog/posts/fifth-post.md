There's a common misconception that once you hit 50, life insurance becomes unaffordable or even impossible to get. Let's be clear: that's simply not true.

You've spent a lifetime building a family, a home, and a legacy. Now is the perfect time to ensure it's all protected. Whether you're an empty nester, nearing retirement, or just realizing you have a gap in your coverage, you have excellent, affordable options.

### Why Your Needs Change After 50

In your 30s and 40s, life insurance is often about protecting your mortgage and replacing your income for your young children. After 50, the focus often shifts to more permanent goals.

### Your Two Main Options

1.  **Term Life Insurance:** Yes, you can still get term insurance! A 10 or 15-year term policy can be a very affordable way to cover the last few years of a mortgage or provide an income bridge to your spouse until they can access retirement funds.
2.  **Permanent Life Insurance (Final Expense):** This is the most common choice for this age group. These policies are designed to last your entire life and have smaller face values (e.g., $10,000 - $50,000) perfectly suited to cover final expenses. They often have simplified underwriting, meaning you may not even need a medical exam.

### What About Cost?

It's true that life insurance is more affordable when you're younger. However, "more expensive" doesn't mean "unaffordable." For a healthy individual in their 50s or 60s, a final expense policy can often be secured for a very manageable monthly premium.

As an independent agent, my job is to shop the market across dozens of carriers who specialize in coverage for your age group to find the plan that fits your budget and gives you peace of mind.

It's never too late to put a plan in place. The peace of mind it brings is priceless.
