# 5 Questions to Ask Before You Buy Any Life Insurance Policy

Buying life insurance can feel overwhelming. It‚Äôs a world of jargon, complex products, and sales pressure. After losing my father without any preparation, I learned firsthand how confusing it can be. That experience is why I became an agent‚Äîto help families navigate this process with clarity and confidence.

Before you sign any application, you deserve to feel 100% certain about your decision. The right agent won‚Äôt just sell you a policy; they will act as your guide.

Here are five critical questions you should ask any life insurance agent to ensure they have your best interests at heart.

### 1. "Are you an independent agent or a captive agent?" ü§î

This is the most important question you can ask, and it reveals everything about who the agent works for.

* **A captive agent** works for a single insurance company. They can only offer you the products their company sells.
* **An independent agent** (like me) works for *you*. We are contracted with dozens of different carriers, allowing us to shop the market to find the best policy for your specific needs and budget.

An independent agent has the freedom to prioritize your needs over the needs of any one company.

### 2. "How will we determine the right *amount* of coverage for me?" üí∞

If an agent immediately suggests a round number like "$1 million" without a deep analysis, be cautious. A professional approach involves a thorough needs analysis, looking at your unique situation.

We use a framework called **DIME** (Debt, Income, Mortgage, Education) to establish a clear, data-driven baseline for your needs. This isn't about guesswork; it's about making sure the people you love are truly protected.

### 3. "Can you explain the difference between Term and Permanent insurance in simple terms?" üè°

This question tests an agent's ability to be a teacher, not just a salesperson. The concepts are simple, and they should be able to explain them without confusing jargon.

* **Term is like renting.** It‚Äôs affordable protection for a specific period, perfect for covering needs that have an end date, like a mortgage or raising children.
* **Permanent is like owning.** It‚Äôs designed to last your entire life and can build cash value, making it a tool for lifelong needs like final expenses or estate planning.

There is no "best" type of insurance‚Äîonly what's best for *your* goals.

### 4. "What does the application and underwriting process look like?" ü©∫

A good agent will be transparent about the entire process, from application to approval. They should be able to explain:

* Whether a medical exam is required.
* The typical timeline for approval.
* How they will keep you updated along the way.

My mission is to make this process as smooth and stress-free as possible. I‚Äôll handle the paperwork and communicate with the carrier so you can focus on your life.

### 5. "How will you support me after the policy is in place?" ü§ù

Your relationship with your agent shouldn't end once you sign the paperwork. Life changes‚Äîyou might have another child, buy a new home, or get a promotion.

A true guide will schedule periodic reviews to ensure your coverage still aligns with your life. This isn't about upselling you; it's about making sure the protection you bought on day one is still the right protection on day one thousand.

Life insurance is more than a financial product; it's a promise to your family. Make sure you're working with someone who honors that promise.
