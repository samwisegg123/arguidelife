# The Best Time to Buy Life Insurance Was Yesterday. The Second Best Time is Now.

When you're young, healthy, and busy building a life, life insurance can feel like something for "later." It's easy to think, "I'll get to it when I'm older," or "I'll think about it when I have kids."

But here's the simple, unchangeable truth of life insurance: **it will never be cheaper for you than it is today.**

This isn't a sales tactic; it's a fact of how the industry works. Your two greatest assets when buying life insurance are your **age** and your **health**, and both are at their peak right now.

## Locking In Your Rate and Your Health

Think of buying life insurance like locking in a mortgage rate. When you're young and in good health, you can lock in an incredibly low "payment" for decades to come.

A 30-year term policy for a healthy 30-year-old is remarkably affordable. That small, fixed monthly premium can guarantee your family's financial security through all of life's biggest milestones:

-   Buying a home 🏡
-   Having children 👶
-   Paying for college 🎓
-   Building a business 📈

If you wait until you're 45, that same policy will be significantly more expensive. Why? Because from an insurance carrier's perspective, the risk has increased. You've also run the risk of developing a health condition in the intervening years that could make your rates even higher, or even make you uninsurable.

## It's Not Just About You

The most important reason to act now is that life insurance isn't really for you. **It's for them.** It's for your spouse, your children, your partner. It's the ultimate safety net that ensures that if the unthinkable happens, their lives and their dreams can continue.

Putting a plan in place today is a simple, powerful, and affordable act of love.
